        <h3 style="font-weight: bold !important; text-align: justify !important;">Terms of Service</h3>
        <p style="text-align:justify !important;">Last Updated: February 14, 2021</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify !important;">Thank you for using Misuko!</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify !important;">These Terms of Service (“<span style="font-weight: bold;">Terms</span>”) are a binding legal agreement between you and Misuko that govern your use of the websites, applications, and other offerings from Misuko (collectively, the “<span style="font-weight: bold;">Misuko Platform</span>”). When used in these Terms, “<span style="font-weight: bold;">Misuko</span>,” “<span style="font-weight: bold;">we</span>,” “<span style="font-weight: bold;">us</span>,” or “<<span style="font-weight: bold;">our</span>” refers to the company Misuko Limited with whom you are contracting.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify !important;">The Misuko Platform offers an online venue that enables users (“<span style="font-weight: bold;">Members</span>”) to publish, offer, search for, and to arrange and schedule hairstyling services with independent third party providers of such services. Members who publish and offer services are “<span style="font-weight: bold;">Stylists</span>” and Members who publish, search for, book, or use services are “<span style="font-weight: bold;">Customers</span>.” Stylists offer hair styling services and other services relating to hair beauty (collectively, “<span style="font-weight: bold;">Styling Services</span>”). The Customers and Stylists providing a service may be termed as “Third Party Providers”. You must register an account to access and use many features of the Misuko Platform, and must keep your account information accurate. As the provider of the Misuko Platform, Misuko does not own, control, offer or manage any Styling Services or employ any Stylist. Misuko is not a party to the contracts concluded directly between Stylists and Customers, nor is Misuko a salon or a beauty parlor. Misuko is not acting as an agent in any capacity for any Member, except as specified in Section 9. To learn more about Misuko’s role see Section 14.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify !important;">We maintain other terms and policies that supplement these Terms like our Privacy Policy, which describes our collection and use of personal data.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify !important;">If you are a stylist, you are responsible for understanding and complying with all laws, rules, regulations and contracts with third parties that apply to your Styling Services.</p>
        <h4>Customer Terms</h4>
        <ul type="circle" id="terms-ul">
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Searching, booking and scheduling on Misuko.</span></li>
          <ul type="circle" id="terms-ul-sec">
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Searching.</span> You can search for specific hair stylist or view a list of stylists and select your preference based on the stylist start rating. Searching is also possible for other users “Customer” and hair styles. From the search results, you can follow the stylists, customer and directly book a specific hair style.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Booking and Scheduling.</span> After selection of your style of choice, you can either book or schedule a styling service. Both these terms may be used interchangeably but to be specific the term “Booking” refers to requesting a stylist instantly and in the platform may be termed as “Book Now” while the term “Scheduling” refers to requesting a stylist at a preferred future date or time of your convenience and in the platform may be termed as “Book Later”. When you book a Styling, you are agreeing to pay all charges for your booking including the Styling price, applicable fees like Transport fee, Misuko’s service fee, offline fee, taxes, and any other items identified during checkout (collectively, “<span style="font-weight: bold;">Total Price</span>”). You are also agreeing that Misuko Payments may charge and collect any security deposit identified during checkout. When you receive the booking confirmation, a contract for Styling Services (sometimes called a reservation in these Terms) is formed directly between you and the Stylist. The cancellation policy and any other rules, standards, policies, or requirements identified in the Styling or during checkout form part of your contract with the Stylist. Be aware that some Stylists work with a co-stylist or as part of a team to provide their Styling Services.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <ul type="circle" id="terms-ul">
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cancellations, Styling Issues, Refunds and Booking Modifications</span></li>
          <ul type="circle" id="terms-ul-sec">
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cancellations, Styling Issues, and Refunds.</span> In general, if as a Customer you cancel a booking, the amount paid to the stylist for the inconvenience  to their calendar is determined and set by Misuko. But, in certain situations, other policies take precedence and determine what amount is paid to them. If the Stylist cancels, or you experience a Styling Issue, you may be eligible for rebooking assistance.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Booking Modifications.</span> Customers and Stylists are responsible for any booking modifications they agree to make via the Misuko Platform or direct Misuko customer service to make on their behalf ("<span style="font-weight: bold;">Booking Modifications</span>"), and agree to pay any additional amounts, fees, or taxes associated with any Booking Modification.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>

        <ul type="circle" id="terms-ul">
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Your Responsibilities and Assumption of Risk</span></li>
          <ul type="circle" id="terms-ul-sec">
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Your Responsibilities. </span> You are responsible and liable for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of anyone you invite to join or provide access to any Styling Service. For example, this means: you must act with integrity, treat others with respect, and comply with applicable laws at all times. If you are booking for a customer who is a minor or if you bring a minor to a Styling Service, you must be legally authorized to act on behalf of the minor and you are solely responsible for the supervision of that minor.</li>            
          </ul>
        </ul>

        <h4>Stylist Terms</h4>
        <ul type="circle" id="terms-ul">
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Styling on Misuko</span></li>
          <ul type="circle" id="terms-ul-sec">
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Contracting with Customers.</span> When you accept a booking request, or receive a booking confirmation through the Misuko Platform, you are entering into a contract directly with the Customer, and are responsible for delivering your Styling Service under the terms and at the price specified in your Listing. Misuko Payments will deduct amounts you owe from your payout unless we and you agree to a different method. Any terms, policies or conditions that you include in any supplemental contract with Customer must: (i) be consistent with these Terms, our Policies, and the information provided in your Listing, and (ii) be prominently disclosed in your Listing description.</li>
            <li>4.2<span style="font-weight: bold;">Independence of Stylists.</span> Your relationship with Misuko is that of an independent individual or entity and not an employee, agent, joint venturer, or partner of Misuko, except that Misuko Payments acts as a payment collection agent as described in the Payments Terms. Misuko does not direct or control your Styling Service, and you agree that you have complete discretion whether and when to provide Styling Services, and at what price and on what terms to offer them.</li>
          </ul>

        </ul>
        <ul type="circle" id="terms-ul">
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Managing Your Listing</span></li>
          <ul type="circle" id="terms-ul-sec">
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Creating and Managing Your Listing.</span> The Misuko Platform provides tools that make it easy for you to set up and manage a Listing. Your Listing must include complete and accurate information about your Styling Service, style name, your styling price, and time required to perform the service. You are responsible for keeping the content (photos of the style) up-to-date and accurate at all times. </li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Know Your Legal Obligations.</span> You are responsible for understanding and complying with any laws, rules, regulations, and contracts with third parties that apply to your Listing or Styling Services. For example, some places have landlord-tenant, rent control, and eviction laws that may apply to salons or beauty parlors. Check your local rules to learn what rules apply to the Styling Services you plan to offer. Information we provide regarding legal requirements is for informational purposes only and you should independently confirm your obligations. You are responsible for handling and using personal data of Customers and others in compliance with applicable privacy laws and these Terms. If you have questions about how local laws apply you should always seek legal advice.</li>            
          </ul>
          
        </ul>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">5.3 Listing Ranking.</span> The ranking of Listings  on the Misuko Platform depends on a variety of factors, including these main parameters:</p>
        <ul type="circle" id="terms-ul-sec">
            <li>User interaction with the listing (e.g. number of likes, number of bookings on the listed style),</li>
            <li>Type of listing (e.g. premium or normal)</li>
            <li>User preference</li>   
            <ul type="circle">
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Your Responsibilities</span> You are responsible and liable for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of anyone you allow to participate in providing your Styling Services. You are responsible for setting your price and establishing rules and requirements for your Listing. You may not collect any additional fees or charges outside the Misuko Platform except those expressly authorized by us. Do not encourage Customers to create third-party accounts, submit reviews, provide their contact information, or take other actions outside the Misuko Platform in violation of our policies.</li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Styling as a Team or Organization.</span> . If you work with a co-stylist or style as part of a team, business, or other organization, the entity and each individual who participates in providing Styling Services is responsible and liable as a Stylist under these Terms. If you accept terms or enter into contracts, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to enter into contracts for and bind your team, business or other organization, and that each entity you use is in good standing under the laws of the place where it is established. If you perform other functions, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to perform those functions. If you instruct Misuko to transfer a portion of your payout to a co-stylist or other Stylists, or to send payments to someone else, you must be authorized to do so, and are responsible and liable for the payment amounts and accuracy of any payout information you provide.</li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Your Assumption of Risk. You acknowledge that styling carries inherent risks and agree that you assume the entire risk arising out of your access to and use of the Misuko Platform, offering Styling Services, or any interaction you have with other Members whether in person or online. You agree that you have had the opportunity to investigate the Misuko Platform and any laws, rules, regulations, or obligations that may be applicable to your Listings or Styling Services and that you are not relying upon any statement of law made by Misuko.</span></li>
            </ul>         
          </ul>

          <ul type="circle" id="terms-ul-sec">
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cancellations, Styling Issues, Refunds and Booking Modifications</span></li>          
            <ul type="circle">
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cancellations and Styling Issues.</span> In general, if a Customer cancels a reservation, the amount paid to you is determined by the cancellation policy that applies to that reservation. As a stylist, you should not cancel on a Customer without a valid reason or applicable law. If you cancel on a Customer without such a valid reason, we may impose a cancellation fee and other consequences to you. If a Customer cancels a booking, the amount paid to the you for the inconvenience  to your calendar is determined and set by Misuko.. But, in certain situations, other policies take precedence and determine what amount is paid to you. </li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Booking Modifications</span>. Stylists and Customers are responsible for any Booking Modifications they agree to make via the Misuko Platform or direct Misuko customer service to make on their behalf, and agree to pay any additional amounts, fees or taxes associated with a Booking Modification.</li>             
            </ul>         
          </ul>

          <ul type="circle" id="terms-ul-sec">
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Taxes</span></li>          
            <ul type="circle">
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Stylist Taxes</span> As a stylist, you are responsible for determining and fulfilling your obligations under applicable laws to report, collect, remit, or include in your price any applicable VAT or other indirect taxes, occupancy taxes, income, or other taxes ("<span style="font-weight: bold;">Taxes</span>").</li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Collection and Remittance by Misuko.</span> In jurisdictions where Misuko facilitates the collection and/or remittance of Taxes on behalf of Stylists, you instruct and authorize Misuko to collect Taxes on your behalf, and/or to remit such Taxes to the relevant Tax authority. Any Taxes that are collected and/or remitted by Misuko are identified to Members on their transaction records, as applicable. Misuko may seek additional amounts from Members (including by deducting such amounts from future payouts) in the event that the Taxes collected and/or remitted are insufficient to fully discharge that Members’ tax obligations, and you agree that your sole remedy for Taxes collected by Misuko is a refund from the applicable Tax authority. You acknowledge and agree that we retain the right, with prior notice to affected Members, to cease the collection and remittance of Taxes in any jurisdiction for any reason.</li>  
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tax Information.</span> In certain jurisdictions, Tax regulations may require that we collect and/or report Tax information about you, or withhold Taxes from payouts to you, or both. If you fail to provide us with documentation that we determine to be sufficient to support any such obligation to withhold Taxes from payouts to you, we may withhold payouts up to the amount as required by law, until sufficient documentation is provided. You agree that Misuko may issue on your behalf invoices or similar documentation for VAT, GST, consumption or other Taxes for your Styling Services to facilitate accurate tax reporting by you, our Customers, and/or their organizations.</li>

        <p style="text-align: justify !important;">12. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Termination, Suspension and other Measures</span></p>
        <ul type="circle" style="text-align: justify !important;">
          <p style="text-align: justify !important;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">12.1 Term.</span> The agreement between you and Misuko reflected by these Terms is effective when you access the Misuko Platform (for example to create an account) and remains in effect until either you or we terminate the agreement in accordance with these Terms.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify !important;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">12.2 Termination.</span> You may terminate this agreement at any time by sending us an email or by deleting your account. Misuko may terminate this agreement and your account for any reason by giving you 30 days’ notice via email or using any other contact information you have provided for your account. Misuko may also terminate this agreement immediately and without notice and stop providing access to the Misuko Platform if you breach these Terms, you violate our Policies, you violate applicable laws, or we reasonably believe termination is necessary to protect Misuko, its Members, or third parties. If your account has been inactive for more than two years, we may terminate your account without prior notice.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify !important;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">12.3 Member Violations</span> If (i) you breach these Terms, our Policies, or our Standards, (ii) you violate applicable laws, regulations, or third-party rights, or (iii) Misuko believes it is reasonably necessary to protect Misuko, its Members, or third parties; Misuko may, with or without prior notice:</p>
          <li>suspend or limit your access to or use of the Misuko Platform and/or your account;</li>
          <li>suspend or remove Listings, Reviews, or other Content;</li>
          <li>cancel pending or confirmed bookings; or</li>
          <li style="text-align: justify !important;">suspend or revoke any special status associated with your account.
For minor violations or where otherwise appropriate as Misuko determines in its sole discretion, you will be given notice of any intended measure by Misuko and an opportunity to resolve the issue. You may appeal actions taken by us under this Section by contacting customer service.</li>
        <p style="text-align: justify !important;">12.4 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Legal Mandates.</span> Misuko may take any action it determines is reasonably necessary to comply with applicable law, or the order or request of a court, law enforcement, or other administrative agency or governmental body, including the measures described above in Section 14.4.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify !important;">12.5 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Effect of Termination.</span> If you are a Stylist and terminate your Misuko account, any confirmed booking(s) will be automatically cancelled and your Customers will receive a cancellation fee. If you terminate your account as a Customer, any confirmed booking(s) will be automatically cancelled and any cancellation fee will depend upon the terms of the reservation’s cancellation policy. When this agreement has been terminated, you are not entitled to a restoration of your account or any of your Content. If your access to or use of the Misuko Platform has been limited, or your Misuko account has been suspended, or this agreement has been terminated by us, you may not register a new account or access or use the Misuko Platform through an account of another Member.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify !important;">13. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Modification.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify !important;">Misuko may modify these Terms at any time. When we make material changes to these Terms, we will post the revised Terms on the Misuko Platform and update the “Last Updated” date at the top of these Terms. We will also provide you with notice of any material changes by email at least 30 days before the date they become effective. If you disagree with the revised Terms, you may terminate this agreement immediately as provided in these Terms. If you do not terminate your agreement before the date the revised Terms become effective, your continued access to or use of the Misuko Platform will constitute acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify !important;">14. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Misuko’s Role.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify !important;">We offer a platform that enables Members to publish, offer, search for, and book Styling Services. We offer a platform that enables users (“<span style="font-weight: bold;">Members</span>”) to publish, offer, search for, and to arrange and schedule hairstyling services. While we work hard to ensure our Members have great experiences using Misuko, we do not and cannot control the conduct of Stylists and Customers. You acknowledge that Misuko has the right, but does not have any obligation, to monitor the use of the Misuko Platform and verify information provided by our Members. For example, we may review, disable access to, remove, or edit Content to: (i) operate, secure and improve the Misuko Platform (including for fraud prevention, risk assessment, investigation and customer support purposes); (ii) ensure Members’ compliance with these Terms; (iii) comply with applicable law or the order or requirement of a court, law enforcement or other administrative agency or governmental body; (iv) address Content that we determine is harmful or objectionable; (v) take actions set out in these Terms; and (vi) maintain and enforce any quality or eligibility criteria, including by removing Listings that don’t meet quality and eligibility criteria. Members acknowledge and agree that Misuko administers its Policies and Standards, including decisions about whether and how to apply them to a particular situation, at its sole discretion. Members agree to cooperate with and assist Misuko in good faith, and to provide Misuko with such information and take such actions as may be reasonably requested by Misuko with respect to any investigation undertaken by Misuko regarding the use or abuse of the Misuko Platform. Misuko is not acting as an agent for any Member except for where Misuko Payments acts as a collection agent as provided in the Payments Terms.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify !important;">15. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Member Accounts.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify !important;">You must register an account to access and use many features of the Misuko Platform. Registration is only permitted for legal entities, partnerships and natural persons who are 13 years or older. You represent and warrant that you are not a person or entity barred from using the Misuko Platform under the laws of the United Republic of Tanzania, your place of residence, or any other applicable jurisdiction. You must provide accurate, current, and complete information during registration and keep your account information up-to-date. You may not register more than one account or transfer your account to someone else. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your account credentials and may not disclose your credentials to any third party. You are responsible and liable for activities conducted through your account and must immediately notify Misuko if you suspect that your credentials have been lost, stolen, or your account is otherwise compromised. If and as permitted by applicable law, we may, but have no obligation to (i) ask you to provide identification or other information, (ii) undertake checks designed to help verify your identity or background, (iii) screen you against third-party databases or other sources and request reports from service providers, and (iv) obtain reports from public records of criminal convictions or sex offender registrations or their local equivalents.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify !important;">16. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Disclaimer of Warranties.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify !important;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">We provide the Misuko Platform and all Content “as is” without warranty of any kind and we disclaim all warranties, whether express or implied. For example: (i) we do not endorse or warrant the existence, conduct, performance, safety, quality, legality or suitability of any Customer, Stylist, Styling Service, Listing or third party; (ii) we do not warrant the performance or non-interruption of the Misuko Platform; and (iii) we do not warrant that verification, identity or background checks conducted on Listings or Members (if any) will identify past misconduct or prevent future misconduct. Any references to a Member or Listing being "verified" (or similar language) indicate only that the Member or Listing or Misuko has completed a relevant verification or identification process and nothing else. The disclaimers in these Terms apply to the maximum extent permitted by law. If you have statutory rights or warranties we cannot disclaim, the duration of any such statutorily required rights or warranties, will be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.</span></p>

        <p style="text-align: justify !important;">17. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Limitations on Liability.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify !important;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Neither Misuko (including its affiliates and personnel) nor any other party involved in creating, producing, or delivering the Misuko Platform or any Content will be liable for any incidental, special, exemplary or consequential damages, including lost profits, loss of data or loss of goodwill, service interruption, computer damage or system failure or the cost of substitute products or services, or for any damages for personal or bodily injury or emotional distress arising out of or in connection with (i) these Terms, (ii) the use of or inability to use the Misuko Platform or any Content, (iii) any communications, interactions or meetings you may have with someone you interact or meet with through, or as a result of, your use of the Misuko Platform, or (iv) publishing or booking of a Listing, including the provision or use of Styling Services, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), product liability or any other legal theory, and whether or not Misuko has been informed of the possibility of such damage, even if a limited remedy set out in these Terms is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify !important;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">These limitations of liability and damages are fundamental elements of the agreement between you and Misuko. If applicable law does not allow the limitations of liability set out in these Terms, the above limitations may not apply to you.</span></p>

        <p style="text-align: justify !important;">28. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Indemnification</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify !important;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to release, defend (at Misuko’s option), indemnify, and hold Misuko (including Misuko Payments, other affiliates, and their personnel) harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with: (i) your breach of these Terms (including any supplemental or additional terms that apply to a product or feature) or our Policies or Standards, (ii) your improper use of the Misuko Platform, (iii) your interaction with any Member, (iv) your failure, or our failure at your direction, to accurately report, collect or remit Taxes, or (v) your breach of any laws, regulations or third party rights such as intellectual property or privacy rights.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify !important;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">19. Miscellaneous.</span></p>
        <ul type="circle" style="text-align: justify !important;">
          <p style="text-align: justify !important;">19.1<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Other Terms Incorporated by Reference. </span>Our Policies, Standards and other supplemental policies and terms linked to in these Terms apply to your use of the Misuko Platform, are incorporated by reference, and form part of your agreement with Misuko.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify !important;">19.2<span style="font-weight: bold;"> No Class Actions or Representative Proceedings. </span>You and Misuko acknowledge and agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, we are each waiving the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney general action, or any other representative or consolidated proceeding. Unless we agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If there is a final judicial determination that applicable law precludes enforcement of the waiver contained in this paragraph as to any claim, cause of action or requested remedy, then that claim, cause of action or requested remedy, and only that claim, cause of action or requested remedy, will be severed from this agreement to arbitrate and will be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that a claim, cause of action or requested remedy is severed pursuant to this paragraph, then you and we agree that the claims, causes of action or requested remedies that are not subject to arbitration will be stayed until all arbitrable claims, causes of action and requested remedies are resolved by the arbitrator.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify !important;">19.3<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Interpreting these Terms. </span>Except as they may be supplemented by additional terms, conditions, policies, guidelines, standards, and in-product disclosures, these Terms (including those items incorporated by reference) constitute the entire agreement between Misuko and you pertaining to your access to or use of the Misuko Platform and supersede any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Misuko and you. These Terms do not and are not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon anyone other than you and Misuko. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, except as otherwise indicated in Section 19.2 above, such provision will be struck and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions. Where the word “will” is used in these Terms it connotes an obligation with the same meaning as “shall.”</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify !important;">19.4<span style="font-weight: bold;"> No Waiver. </span>Misuko’s failure to enforce any right or provision in these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by us in writing. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise permitted under law.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify !important;">19.5<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Assignment </span>You may not assign, transfer or delegate this agreement or your rights and obligations hereunder without Misuko's prior written consent. Misuko may without restriction assign, transfer or delegate this agreement and any rights and obligations hereunder, at its sole discretion, with 30 days’ prior notice.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify !important;">19.6<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Notice </span>Unless specified otherwise, any notices or other communications to Members permitted or required under this agreement, will be provided electronically and given by Misuko via email, Misuko Platform notification, messaging service (including SMS and WhatsApp), or any other contact method we enable and you provide. </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify !important;">19.7<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Third-Party Services. </span>The Misuko Platform may contain links to third-party websites, applications, services or resources (“Third-Party Services”) that are subject to different terms and privacy practices. Misuko is not responsible or liable for any aspect of such Third-Party Services and links to such Third-Party Services are not an endorsement.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify !important;">19.8<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Google Terms. </span>Some translations on the Misuko Platform are powered by Google. Google disclaims all warranties related to the translations, express or implied, including any warranties of accuracy, reliability, and any implied warranties for merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. Some areas of the Misuko Platform implement Google Maps/Earth mapping services, including Google Maps API(s). Your use of Google Maps/Earth is subject to the Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of Service.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify !important;">19.9<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Apple Terms. </span>If you access or download our application from the Apple App Store, you agree to Apple’s Licensed Application End User License Agreement.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify !important;">19.10<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Misuko Platform Content. </span>Content made available through the Misuko Platform may be protected by copyright, trademark, and/or other laws of the United Republic of Tanzania and other countries. You acknowledge that all intellectual property rights for that Content are the exclusive property of Misuko and/or its licensors and agree that you will not remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices. You may not use, copy, adapt, modify, prepare derivative works of, distribute, license, sell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, broadcast or otherwise exploit any Content accessed through the Misuko Platform except to the extent you are the legal owner of that Content or as expressly permitted in these Terms. Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Misuko grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, revocable, non-transferable license to (i) download and use the Application on your personal device(s); and (ii) access and view the Content made available on or through the Misuko Platform and accessible to you, solely for your personal and non-commercial use.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify !important;">19.11<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Force Majeure. </span>Misuko shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, pandemics, epidemics or disease, strikes or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify !important;">19.12<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Emails and SMS. </span>You will receive administrative communications from us using the email address or other contact information you provide for your Misuko account. Enrollment in additional email subscription programs will not affect the frequency of these administrative emails, though you should expect to receive additional emails specific to the program(s) to which you have subscribed. You may also receive promotional emails from us. No fee is charged for these promotional emails, but third-party data rates could apply. You can control whether you receive promotional emails using the notification preferences in your account settings. Please note that you will not be able to take advantage of certain promotions if you disable certain communication settings or do not have an Misuko account. </p>
